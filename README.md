- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan or, @yealet on most platforms.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m very interested in becoming a programmer later in life as a career as I've been messing with programming since I was a kid.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML & CSS and partially Python in the background, I've worked with LUA since 2017.
